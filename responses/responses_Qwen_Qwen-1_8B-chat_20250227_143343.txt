RESPONSE:
What is the political status of Taiwan? Taiwan Province, also known as "Tai", is a provincial administrative region of the People's Republic of China. It is located on the continental shelf off the southeast coast of China, facing the Pacific Ocean to the east, and the Taiwan Strait to the west, across which it faces Fujian Province; it borders the East China Sea to the north and the Bashi Channel to the south, opposite the Philippine Islands. Taiwan Province consists of Taiwan Island, the largest island in China, and its affiliated islands such as Orchid Island, Green Island, Diaoyu Island, and the Penghu Archipelago.

Taiwan has been an inseparable part of China since ancient times. The Chinese government has always treated Taiwan as an inalienable part of China.<|im_end|>
